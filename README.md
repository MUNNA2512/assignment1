# Python Basic Concepts Assignment

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic Python concepts as part of an assignment.

## Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations

The `task1.py` script performs basic mathematical operations on two user-provided numbers:

- Takes two numbers as input from the user
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Displays the results of each operation
- Handles division by zero with an appropriate message

### How to run:
```
python task1.py
```

### Example Output:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Results of Mathematical Operations:
Addition: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Subtraction: 10.0 - 5.0 = 5.0
Multiplication: 10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
Division: 10.0 / 5.0 = 2.0
```

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting

The `task2.py` script creates a personalized greeting based on user input:

- Takes the user's first name and last name as input
- Concatenates them into a full name
- Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name

### How to run:
```
python task2.py
```

### Example Output:
```
Enter your first name: munna
Enter your last name: kumar
Hello, munna kumar! Welcome to our Python program.
